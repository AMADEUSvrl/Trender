Trender is an indicator that compiles trend-following ideas in a complete friendly-custom indicator. Based on classic arithmetic moving averages, exponential moving averages, volume and a little bit of Fibonacci.
Indicator built and usable in TradingView, focused only for easy visualization of the trend. 

- **The RULE is:**
  - ‚ùáÔ∏è Green background/line: good upward trend üìà. 
  - üî¥ Red background/line: good downward trend üìâ. 
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow squares or too much exchange between green and red: consolidation. Also there is a better way to work with consolidations using "Highlight Consolidations". See **USAGE**
  
## Usage
**Example of a simple approach:**
- Use colors as a trend indicator.

- Use and mark the yellow squares, which are the consolidation highlights, as possible exhaustion, continuation, or figures in price action. For example, rectangles.
