Trender is an indicator that compiles trend-following ideas in a complete friendly-custom indicator. Based on classic arithmetic moving averages, exponential moving averages, volume and a little bit of Fibonacci.
Indicator built and usable in TradingView, focused only for easy visualization of the trend. 

- **The GOLD RULE is:**
  - ❇️ Green background: good upward trend 📈. 
  - 🔴 Red background: good downward trend 📉. 
  - ⚠️ Yellow or too much exchange between green and red: consolidation.
